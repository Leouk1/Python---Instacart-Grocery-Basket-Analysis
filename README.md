# Instacart Customer Segmentation Analysis (Python Project)

This project is part of Achievement 4 in my CareerFoundry Data Analytics program. I’m working as an analyst for Instacart, an online grocery delivery company. Instacart already performs well, but they want a deeper understanding of their customer behavior so they can improve how they target different customer groups.

My job was to carry out an exploratory analysis of Instacart’s datasets and uncover sales patterns, customer habits, and meaningful segments. The insights from this project are meant to support a more focused marketing strategy and help Instacart send the right promotions to the right customers.

## Key Questions

The Instacart team wants data-driven answers to several questions, including:

Which days of the week and times of day receive the most orders?

Are there hours when customers tend to spend more money?

How can Instacart group products into simple price ranges?

Which departments see the highest ordering frequency?

How do customer profiles differ in terms of brand loyalty, region, family status, age, and income?

What patterns can we see in ordering habits across different demographic groups?

## These insights will help marketing and sales decide:

When to run ads

Which products to promote

How to tailor campaigns to specific customer types

### Stakeholders

VP of Marketing — wants to improve ad targeting

SVP of Sales — wants to understand weaker product areas and improve them

Instacart Customers — want relevant recommendations and promotions

## Data

I worked with a mix of open-source Instacart datasets and a fictional customer dataset provided by CareerFoundry. All datasets share common identifiers, which allowed me to merge everything into one unified dataframe for analysis.

The project uses:

Instacart’s open-source 2017 dataset (via Kaggle) www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017

A synthetic customer dataset created for educational purposes

Approach

The full analysis was completed in Python, using:

pandas

NumPy

matplotlib

seaborn

SciPy

Jupyter Notebook

My workflow included:

Importing and checking all datasets

Cleaning data (duplicates, missing values, mixed types)

Creating new variables where needed

Merging all datasets into one final master file

Running exploratory analysis

Producing visualizations to highlight key insights

Segmenting customers based on demographics and shopping behavior

I followed industry-standard folder structure and naming conventions throughout the project, keeping the code clean, documented, and easy to follow.

## Deliverables

This repository includes:

A structured project folder with scripts, notebooks, visual outputs, and reports

A merged and cleaned master dataset (excluding raw data)

Clear, labelled visualizations answering stakeholder questions

A final report summarizing insights and recommendations

Proper citations for the Instacart datasets
